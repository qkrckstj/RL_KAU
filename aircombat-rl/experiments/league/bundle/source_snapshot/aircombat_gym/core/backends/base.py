"""Backend contract.  Everything above this line is unaware of JSBSim.

The backend is deliberately *low level*: it takes control-surface commands and
advances physics.  Autopilot lives in `control/`, one layer up, so the two can be
replaced independently -- swapping the autopilot implementation (hand-written vs
LQR vs learned) must not require touching the simulator wrapper.
