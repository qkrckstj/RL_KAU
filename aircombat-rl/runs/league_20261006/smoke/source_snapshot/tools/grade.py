The grader touches one symbol: `Policy(weights).act(obs)`.  It knows neither the
algorithm nor the network; the contract is in `tools.policies`.

    band     `TEST_BAND` + 0..n-1.  Never seen in training, never used to pick a
             snapshot -- `val` does that, and scoring on `val` reads about 2x
             optimistic.  Real marking passes `--band` with a band that is not
             in this repository.
    n        40 engagements, so two scores can be read side by side.
    seats    red only, unless the assignment is in `SYMMETRIC_SEATS` -- then
             the 40 split 20 per seat, as a control on position.  A seat bias
             has turned up here before.
    policy   greedy.

**Compare standard scores only with each other.**  The same weights read 0.94 at
n=50 and 0.88 at n=40.  40 separates 0.88 from 0.28, the gap the ladder is built
on; it does not separate 0.88 from 0.94, and no honest n here would.
