One file per task.  `base.py` holds what they share: `Combat` runs the two
aircraft and records what the weapon did, `TaskEnv` is the Gymnasium surface and
decides who won.  A task supplies its starting geometries, its opponent, and -- if its
difficulty needs it -- its own `verdict()`.  The two armed duels share
`DuelEnv`, which adds the `mutual` outcome.

Every environment hands out the same 39-channel observation (`aircombat_gym.wvr.obs`)
so a policy trained on one rung loads into the next.  None of them computes a
reward: that is the student's job, and `tests/test_envs.py` enforces it.
