`AdvantagedFight` with the initiative taken away.  Same opponent, same gun, same
clock, same closed vertical.  What changes is where the fight starts.

Abeam, 10,000 m apart, opposite headings, each on the other's 3/9 line.  The
picture is unchanged by rotating it 180 degrees about the midpoint, so the two
aircraft see the same problem: neither starts inside the other's turn, and
neither is looking at the other.  Both have to convert before they can shoot.

**Both aircraft start at the same speed**, 450 kt give or take 10 %, and each
nose is jittered 10 degrees either side of abeam.  Equal energy is the point:
drawing a speed per side would decide the fight before it began.  The throttle
is open from the first step, so what a pilot does with that energy is still
entirely up to it.

The separation was 2,000 m and is now 10,000 m, because at 2,000 m nothing
happened: 200 engagements, every pairing, 200 timeouts.  Two aircraft each
drawing a 1,070 m radius circle from 2,000 m apart never enter each other's
turn, so it is a Lufbery from the merge and no amount of clock resolves it.  At
10,000 m they have to convert before they arrive -- five quadrant transitions in
the first minute against none at 2 km -- and damage starts being traded.

The variety is deliberately thin, and the cost is worth stating.  A policy's
observation is entirely relative, so translating or rotating this setup produces
a byte-identical input; what is left is 20 degrees of jitter and 90 kt of common
speed.  A policy here learns one fight very well.  `AdvantagedFight`, whose
bearing and blue heading are drawn over the full circle, is where variety lives.

**Two copies of one script will not resolve this.**  With the geometry exactly
fixed, `ace`, `lead` and `pursuit` all score 0.00 with 60 timeouts out of 60:
identical aircraft flown identically mirror each other forever, which is a
Lufbery and not a bug.  A random policy still loses 60 out of 60, so kills are
reachable -- it is symmetry, not the weapon, that prevents them.  So the
scripted baselines calibrate nothing here; the reference that means something is
a *learned* policy against `ace`, because those two are not the same pilot.

Why this and not the head-on merge people picture when they hear "even": a
nose-to-nose pass ends in mutual destruction 29 times in 30.  `flat_damage`
overrides the aspect factor that would make a head-on shot weak, so both
aircraft solve each other at the same moment.  Abeam avoids that without
favouring anyone.
