"""Backend + autopilot, stepped at the decision rate.

This is what the env and the flight-test tools both drive.  One `step()` is one
policy decision (20 Hz); the autopilot loops run underneath at physics rate,
because closing a bank loop at 20 Hz is not the same thing at all.

Command semantics, which are subtler than they look:

  delta != 0   target = current state + delta, recomputed every decision.  The
               target therefore stays just ahead of the aircraft for as long as
               the action is held, which makes it a *rate* command: hold "+30"
               and you turn at maximum performance indefinitely.  This is what
               LAG does, and why its increments are small.
  delta == 0   the target is *frozen*, not re-derived.  Re-deriving would set
               target = current, leaving zero error, so nothing would hold the
               aircraft against drift -- measured 400 -> 420 kt in 10 s of
               "hold".  Freezing makes action 0 mean what the spec says it
               means: keep this heading and this speed.
