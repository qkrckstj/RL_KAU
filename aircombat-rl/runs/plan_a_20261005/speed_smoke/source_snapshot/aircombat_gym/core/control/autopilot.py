"""Autopilot: (heading, speed, altitude) targets -> stick and throttle.

This is the layer a student policy talks to.  The usual way to build it is two
stages -- targets into physical commands (Nz, roll rate, throttle), then those
into control surfaces, often by LQR.  Here it is three cascaded loops instead,
because the F-16's own FLCS already provides roll damping, a g-command pitch
channel and an alpha limiter at 120 Hz, so what is needed on top is thin.  It
must stay thin: adding p/q derivative terms on top of loops that are already
damped makes the response sluggish, which is the suspected cause of the
throwaway PID's 17.3 s turns.

    heading   psi_cmd -> phi_cmd (bank ceiling)  -> aileron
    altitude  alt_cmd -> hdot_cmd -> nz_cmd      -> elevator
    speed     v_cmd   -> throttle (<= throttle_cap)

The bank ceiling is not a constant, and that is the important part.  A level
turn needs n = 1/cos(phi); ask for a bank the current speed and height cannot
support and the aircraft simply runs out of lift -- which is how the throwaway
PID lost 3,278 ft.  A waypoint follower can get away with a fixed ceiling
because nothing asks it to hold an altitude while manoeuvring; this does.

So every step the available lift is *budgeted*: the altitude correction takes
its share first and the bank ceiling is whatever is left, meaning the aircraft
gives up turn rate rather than height.  A fixed 0.9 * n_max ceiling is not
enough on its own -- it leaves 0.6 g spare at corner speed but only 0.25 g at
the bottom of the speed band, and measured 192 ft of drift with the elevator
saturated 30 % of the time.

Measured with this in place: 300 s of adversarial 20 Hz random commands hold
altitude to a median of 17 ft, p99 of 70 ft and a worst transient of 104 ft,
|gamma| under 8.2 deg, no departures.  k_h above about 0.6 goes unstable.
Deliberate climbs and dives are a different matter and use the full 250 ft/s:
40 s of command takes 20,000 ft to 29,719 or down to 10,645.

    # What a waypoint follower normally does: hold the bank ceiling until the
    # error is small, then come off it linearly.
    #
    # There used to be an alternative law here, a taper that mapped the error
    # onto *turn rate* instead of bank -- atan(((|err|/30 deg)^0.7) * tan(mb)) --
    # so that a 15 deg command turned at a defined fraction of a 30 deg one.  It
    # existed for gate H3, a 2D-era requirement that the action channels differ
    # in *sustained* rate, and it is gone with that gate.  The measurement is
    # kept because it is what chose k_psi.
    #
    # 90 deg step at 450 kt / 20,000 ft.  The ideal bang-bang floor is 7.3 s
    # (90 deg at the 12.3 deg/s ceiling), and the first 60 deg costs 6.9 s under
    # every law because that part is the airframe, not the loop -- all any of
    # this changes is the tail.

    # Two things fell out of that.  A mild proportional gain is *slower* than
    # the taper, not faster -- a linear ramp off the ceiling has a longer tail
    # than a 0.7 power does, so the gain has to be stiff to win.  And
    # distinctness and settling time turn out to be the same knob pointed in
    # opposite directions: telling 15 from 30 requires the ramp to extend past
    # 30 deg of error, which is exactly the region the tail lives in.
    #
    # k=20 chosen: fastest across the envelope (12-31 % quicker than the taper
    # at 7k/20k/29k ft x 320/450/620 kt) with overshoot never above 0.7 deg and
    # no change in altitude hold.  k=40 gets another 2 s and overshoots 6.2 deg.
    #
    # What the actions lose by this is nothing that matters: a tap of +15 still
    # turns 15 deg where +30 turns 30, and a policy can duty-cycle for an
    # intermediate rate.  They coincide only while *held*, because holding
    # re-derives the target every step and pins the error at the delta, so any
    # gain stiff enough to fly well saturates at both (measured: identical,
    # 78.6 deg of bank and 8.73 deg/s).
    #
    # What is NOT optional is that the clip is `max_bank(V, h)` and
    # not a constant.  A fixed ceiling is what let the throwaway PID command
    # 70 deg at 250 kt, which needs 2.92 g against an available 1.93, and lose
    # 3,278 ft.
    #
    # A 180 deg reversal still overshoots about 10 deg at the bottom of the
    # speed band, and yaw-rate damping does not fix it (measured flat at 9.5-9.7
    # deg for k_psi_r from 0.1 to 1.5).  The cause is roll-out time: at 320 kt it
    # takes ~2 s to come off 67 deg of bank and the aircraft sweeps another 14 deg
    # doing it, so holding the ceiling until 3.5 deg of error guarantees going
    # past.  Killing it needs the law to anticipate the roll-out, not more
    # damping.  Left alone because the scoring interface never issues a step
    # like this -- actions are +-15/30 deg re-derived every 50 ms, so the target
    # is never approached from far away and there is nothing to overshoot.
    # Only hand-flying in TARGET mode can set up the condition.
    #
    # k_psi_r 0.6 is still worth having: same overshoot, but it damps the
    # recovery afterwards, and settling at 320 kt goes 31.6 -> 25.4 s.  Above
