"""The flight-model bench.  Both control layers, one aircraft, `tab` to switch.

**This is not the tool for feeling the gym.**  `aircombat_gym.wvr.play` is: it
goes through `env.step()` with the task's own action space, so what you feel
there is what a policy is up against.  This bench is for the layer underneath --
the airframe, the FLCS, and the autopilot on top of them -- and most of what it
can do is something no policy can ask for.  Use it to answer "what is the
aircraft capable of, and what does the controller do with my command".

  STICK      you drive the control surfaces and the autopilot is bypassed.
             This is the f16 FLCS and nothing of ours.
  AUTOPILOT  you set (heading, speed, altitude) and the controller works out
             bank, g and throttle.  This is the interface a policy commands
             through, one level above the action space itself.

`tab` hands the aircraft over live, which is the test neither layer can run on
its own: put it inverted in a 60 deg dive with the stick, press tab, and see
whether the autopilot gets it back.  An untrained policy will reach attitudes
the autopilot's own test never leaves its envelope to find.

Three things about the stick surprise everyone, all measured:

  roll is a *rate* command.  `aileron-cmd-norm` feeds a roll-rate loop (full
      stick asks 180 deg/s, 196 measured), so holding the key does not settle at
      a bank angle -- it keeps rolling.  You set the bank and you take it off.
  it does not come back.  Centre the stick from 45 deg of bank and it rolls all
      the way to 175 -- inverted -- and stops there.  The bundled f16 holds
      6-7 deg of rudder at zero command, which makes 2 deg of sideslip, which
      rolls it; once inverted the sideslip washes out and it settles
      (JSBSim discussion #814).  Wings level is a job, not a default.
  pitch is a *g* command.  Elevator 0 is exactly 1 g in every flight condition
      (9 measured, trim elevator 0.0000), so centring holds the flight path
      angle you are on -- including straight down.

Rudder is nearly useless and feeling that is worth the keypress: five seconds of
full pedal moves the heading 1.6 deg, against 35-50 deg for the same time spent
banking.  The FLCS yaw damper cancels most of what the pilot asks for.

One key set for both layers.  The letters are the keypad's 3x3 block mirrored
onto the home row, so the aircraft flies one-handed from either -- laptops
without a keypad lose nothing.  Arrows and Home/PageUp/End/PageDown/Insert/
Delete work too: they are what the keypad sends with NumLock off.

  BACKSPACE       new random engagement (full reset)
  p / esc         pause / quit
  + - / g         zoom / trail length

The vertical axis is the one place the layers disagree, on purpose: W is
stick-forward in STICK (nose down) and the altitude target going up in AUTOPILOT.
Stick convention against autopilot convention -- they really are opposite, so
the panel spells out which one is live.

AUTOPILOT takes commands two ways and `m` toggles.  What differs is the grain,
and keeping both is most of the point: feeling how coarse the policy's grid is
*against* a control you can place exactly is what `wvr/play` cannot show you,
because it only has the grid.

  CONTINUOUS  keys move the setpoint itself, finely, and it stays where you left
              it -- turn strength is how far ahead you put it.  A tap nudges and
              holding sweeps: heading 2 deg / 40 deg/s, altitude 25 ft /
              500 ft/s, speed 5 kt / 100 kt/s.  A piloting aid; no policy has
              this interface.
  DISCRETE    keys emit the action deltas a policy emits, at the decision rate:
              heading +-30 deg, speed +-20 kt, altitude +-1000 ft.  Tapping
              lands the turn; holding re-derives the target from the current
              state every step, so the aircraft never catches up and the
              manoeuvre is sustained.  This is `wvr/actions.py` and nothing else.

`--tacview` serves TacView Advanced over TCP; it is Windows-only, so drop it on
macOS and Linux and the pygame panel is all of it.  `--acmi` records a file
anywhere and plays back in the free viewer.

`--enemy` puts a scripted opponent up, refereed by `envs.base.Combat` -- the
same weapon, the same lock and both barrels, so a shot that tells here tells
there.  The bench used to keep its own books and they had drifted apart.

# --- stick: how fast a key press becomes deflection --------------------------
# A keyboard is on/off and a stick is not.  Ramping matters most on roll: it is
# a rate command, so without fine control you can only ask for 180 deg/s and
# will never stop on a bank angle.  Measured, holding the roll key then letting
# go at 450 kt (`--ramp 0.4`):
#
#     hold   stick reaches   settles at
#     0.05s      0.12          0.8 deg

#     0.40s      1.00        keeps rolling
#
# So the whole useful range lives inside half a second of keypress, which is
# why it feels twitchy.  A slower ramp spreads the same range over more time; it
# does not make roll less sensitive, because the sensitivity is the rate command
# itself.  Nothing holds a bank angle here -- that is what AUTOPILOT is for.

#
# Sized against what the aircraft can do.  Autopilot asks for the full available
# turn rate at 30 deg of heading error and turns at at most ~13 deg/s, so at
# 20 Hz repeat 2 deg a press sweeps the target at 40 deg/s: under a second of
# held key outruns the aircraft and establishes a maximum-rate turn, while one
# tap is a 2 deg nudge, about 7 % of full rate, which fine tracking needs.

# at 500 ft of error, so a second of held key again asks for everything.

    differentiates -- energy height -- is a *length*: the altitude reachable by
    trading away all the speed.  With altitude open that reading means what it
    says, and the split matters as much as the total, because n_max falls by
    nearly half between 5,000 and 30,000 ft.  Energy kept as height buys a
    better wing when it is cashed in.
