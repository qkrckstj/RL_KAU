"""`StateSpec v2` -- the observation every task hands out.  39 raw channels.

**This is an instrument panel, not a network input.**  Everything is a raw SI
quantity: metres, metres per second, radians, g, seconds.  Nothing is
normalised, nothing is clipped, no angle is pre-wrapped into sin/cos, and no
relative geometry is computed.  Turning this into something a network can learn
from is the student's job, and it is a graded part of the assignment.

Three properties, and each one is load-bearing.

**Mirror-symmetric.**  Every quantity that belongs to one aircraft appears
twice, `own_` and `opp_`, in that order.  Swap the seats and the vector permutes
into itself -- which is a property `tests/test_envs.py` asserts rather than a
claim this docstring makes, and which the last rung of the ladder depends on,
because a tournament puts each submission in both seats.

v1 broke it in two places: `own_in_wez` had no counterpart, and a single
`dist_to_boundary` served whoever was asking.  Both were derivable, so nothing
was hidden -- what was wrong showed up in the answer key.  Handing out my half
of the gun for free and making the other half homework produced twenty-one
reward functions in a row that paid for own aim angle and none that paid for
his, in a task where the opponent's nose is what separates the two quadrants
worth having from the two that are not.

**Task-invariant.**  The same 39 channels come out of every rung of the ladder.
Channels that are constant in a given task stay in the vector anyway -- in
`Circular` the altitudes never move and `own_health` never drops -- because a
policy trained there has to load unchanged into a duel, and that is impossible
if the input width changes underneath it.  "Work out which inputs are useless"
is part of the exercise.

**Raw.**  Measured with behaviour cloning: handing over the precomputed gun
geometry (ATA, aspect, lead) is worth two kills out of thirty against handing
over raw 6-DOF -- 29/30 against 27/30.  The representation is not what makes
this task hard, so there is no reason to spend the teaching opportunity on it.

**Not normalised.**  This one has a cost and it is deliberate.  `x` arrives as
20,000-odd metres and a network fed that directly will diverge, loudly, on the
first backward pass.  The alternative is worse: an earlier draft normalised
position by 10 km and clipped to [-1, 1], which fails *silently* -- the target
of this task orbits at up to 9.6 km radius (325 kt at 1 deg/s), both aircraft
saturate independently, and two jets a kilometre apart read as the same point.
A loud failure a student can debug beats a quiet one nobody sees.

The derived *geometry* a reward needs -- range, ATA, aspect, the lead angle --
is not here.  It comes out in the `info` dict instead, which keeps observation
engineering and reward engineering as separate exercises.  `in_wez` is the one
crossing: it is a fact about the match rather than about the geometry (it
depends on the weapon's cone and range band, which a student cannot read off a
position), so both sides of it are in the vector *and* in `info`.

**Why this is at the top of the package and not under `envs/`.**  It is the
contract a student writes against -- `from aircombat_gym.wvr import obs as O` is in
every submission -- and it is deliberately the same for every environment on the
ladder.  Filing it under one of them would suggest it belongs to that one.
