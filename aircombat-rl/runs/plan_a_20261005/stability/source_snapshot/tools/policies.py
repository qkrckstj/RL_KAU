"""Load a design and get something that flies.  Shared by `grade` and `watch`.

**A design folder is three files.**

    <design>/
        policy.py                defines `Policy`     <- network and how to run it
        wrappers.py              defines `State`      <- what the policy sees
        policy_net.pth           the parameters

and the grader touches exactly one symbol:

    from policy import Policy
    p = Policy("policy_net.pth")
    action = p.act(obs)                       # obs is the 39 raw channels

**Nothing here knows what is inside** -- not the algorithm, not the layer names,
not whether torch is involved.  The contract is *a policy that runs*, not the
shape of a weight file, so widening the network or bringing PPO costs the
grader nothing.

The reward is not in the contract: greedy replay never calls one.
