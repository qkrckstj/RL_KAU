"""Scripted opponents for the gun.

A bot is anything with `reset()` and `act(info) -> (d_heading, d_speed, d_alt)`
-- the same three deltas a policy emits.  `info` is one side's dict out of
`envs.base.Combat.observe()`, not the observation vector: these are the
referee's aircraft, not entrants, so they may read the state directly.

They form a ladder, and the rungs are about *what the learner has to discover*:

    circler   holds a turn and ignores you.  Anything that can point and close
              scores; difficulty is the turn rate.
    pursuit   points at you and pulls.  The obvious strategy, and the one a
              learner has to beat before it can claim anything.
    lead      aims where you will be.  Same effort as pursuit, so a score gap
              between them is a difference in aiming and nothing else.
    ace       lead pursuit plus closure control.  The strongest reference, and
              what the assignment's baselines are measured against.
    evader    cruises, then breaks hard in a random direction when you close.
              The first opponent that answers back, and the first a memorised
              open-loop answer cannot beat.

Plain Python on a dict, so they run without torch.

    here ignores `obs` -- they are written against geometry, and the vector
    would only make them longer.  It is in the signature for `PolicyDriver`,
    which cannot work without it: `info` carries no positions, so the
    39-channel observation cannot be rebuilt from it.

    The env passes both rather than letting the driver reach back for them, so
    that "which snapshot does each pilot decide from" is settled in one place.
    That question has bitten once already -- calling `observe()` a second time
    inside `step` gave the opponent a quarter-step-fresher view of health, and
    `ace` in both seats then lost as red 100 times out of 100.

    stops being trivially catchable, something is wrong with the weapon or the

    `turn_rate_deg_s` is an **average**, not an instantaneous rate.  The action
    grid has one turn magnitude, so a slow turn is that 30 deg step commanded
    rarely: the target rolls in, turns, rolls out and flies straight until the
    next one.  Measured over 120 s -- 1 deg/s gives 4 commands and 62 % of the
    time wings-level, 5 deg/s gives 20 and 6 %.  A polygon, not a circle, and at
    1 deg/s a policy is mostly learning to attack a straight target.

    The rate is carried rather than divided into a duty cycle, which is the bug
    this replaced: commanding the step every `period`-th decision demands
    600/period deg/s against an airframe that delivers 12, so every period ever

    something whose next move depends on where the attacker is.  The 2D version
    measured exactly this: the same algorithm went from 2 kills out of 12
    against a scripted circle to 10 out of 12 against a reactive opponent,
