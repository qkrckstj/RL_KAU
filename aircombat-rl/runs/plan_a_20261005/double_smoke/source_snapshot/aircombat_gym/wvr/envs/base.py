"""The two aircraft, the weapon bookkeeping, and the Gymnasium surface.

Two classes, and the split between them is the one that matters:

    Combat    runs both aircraft and *records* what the weapon did -- health,
              how long each side has held a firing solution, the clock.  It
              decides nothing.
    TaskEnv   the Gymnasium environment.  It decides: `verdict()` says what ends
              a match and who won, and each task overrides it as far as it
              needs to.

Judging used to happen in both places -- a `Report` built here and then ignored
by the env, which re-derived the same answer from health and time.  Two judges
drift; the timeout rule already had.

**No reward.**  `step` returns 0.0, always.  The material for a reward goes out
in `info` and the student writes the function -- `tests/test_envs.py` walks the
package AST to keep it that way.

A task is one file next to this one.  It supplies `sample()`, sets a few
class attributes, and overrides `verdict()` if its difficulty needs it.

    Ported from the 2D version on 2026-08-10.  Three things had to change, and
    the first is the kind of bug that hides until the day it does not:

      * `_kin` had `vz = -h_dot` while `look()` measures `dz` upward-positive.
        With the vertical locked and `h_dot` near zero it was invisible; open

        horizontal component is `v*cos(gamma)`, not `v`, for the same reason.

        work out how long to hold the shot, because the answer depends on three

        `wez_cone_deg` and `flat_damage` are arguments rather than module

        `armed` names the sides that carry one.  An aircraft left out of it has
        no gun at all: no solution, no damage, and `under_track` reads 0 for
