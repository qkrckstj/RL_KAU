"""Flight envelope constants, measured from JSBSim F-16 at H0.

Every number was measured at H0, not guessed.  Change H0 and they have to be
measured again: `n_max` is a function of dynamic pressure.

The one that matters most is `max_bank`.  It is what makes the 2D lock possible:
by never commanding more bank than the current speed can hold in level flight,
the altitude loop is never asked for lift the aircraft cannot make.  As a side
effect it also produces corner speed as an emergent rule -- slow aircraft simply
cannot turn.

# --- altitude ----------------------------------------------------------------
# H0 is where episodes start.  Whether the policy may leave it is a config
# choice: locked (v3) or open (v4).  Opening it is what puts energy management
# back in the game -- peak turn rate runs 17.7 deg/s at 5,000 ft against
# 9.4 at 30,000, so altitude buys turn performance and not just speed.

# --- where the arena sits on the globe --------------------------------------
# Only TacView cares.  The game runs in a local tangent plane whose origin is
# this point, so moving it changes nothing physical.  Seoul, so replays open
# somewhere recognisable.
#
# NOTE: set the initial condition through ic/lat-geod-deg, not ic/lat-gc-deg.
# The latter is geocentric and lands the aircraft 0.19 deg (21 km) north.
CENTER_LAT_DEG = 37.5665
CENTER_LON_DEG = 126.9780

# --- speed band (D24) -------------------------------------------------------
# 150 kt measures n_max = 0.90, so level flight is impossible there, but the
# real floor is much higher than "can it fly".  Under 300 s of adversarial 20 Hz
# random commands the altitude lock holds to 93 ft at 300 kt, 157 ft at 275 and
# 342 ft at 250: below 300 the aircraft is lift-starved, the elevator saturates
# a quarter of the time and it can no longer climb back to H0 while turning.
#
# The band still carries the game: turn rate runs 8.4 deg/s at the floor,
# 12.9 at corner speed and 10.3 at the ceiling -- a 1.53x spread with a clear peak.
#
# The ceiling was set to what the aircraft could reach in level flight at the
# old 0.75 throttle cap -- 649 KTAS, Mach 1.11 here -- because commanding more
# than it can reach just creates a dead zone at the top of the action range.
# With the cap lifted it is reachable with margin (0.90 would take it to 699),
# and it is now the binding constraint: the speed loop targets 650 and never
# asks for more throttle than that needs, about 0.89.
V_MIN_KT = 300.0
V_MAX_KT = 650.0

# --- throttle ceiling (D23) -------------------------------------------------
# A game-balance knob, not physics.  Uncapped: `V_MAX_KT` binds above ~0.89, so
# raising it past 0.9 changes nothing in level flight -- what it changes is how
# fast the aircraft recovers speed.
THROTTLE_CAP = 1.00

# --- lift held back for altitude control -------------------------------------
# An *absolute* reserve, not a percentage.  0.9 * n_max leaves 0.6 g spare at
# corner speed but only 0.25 g at the floor, which is where the aircraft
# actually needs it -- and that is what produced a 192 ft excursion before this
# was changed.  Autopilot allocates the same way: altitude takes its g first and
# the bank ceiling gets what is left (see control/autopilot.py).
N_RESERVE = 0.35

# --- structural limit --------------------------------------------------------
# The bundled f16 has no g limiter of its own -- measured n_max keeps climbing
# past 9 at high speed, which would let a fast aircraft turn nearly as well as
# one at corner speed and flatten the whole energy game.  The real F-16 is a
# 9 g airframe.
N_STRUCT = 9.0

G = 9.80665
KT_TO_MS = 0.514444

# --- measured maximum load factor vs speed AND altitude, full AB -------------
# Peak Nz within 1.5 s of full aft stick from trimmed level flight, capped at
# N_STRUCT.  Below roughly 450 kt the alpha limiter binds; above it the FLCS
# g-command saturates, except low down where the 9 g airframe limit is real.
#
# The altitude axis is what makes the vertical worth flying.  Peak turn rate:
#    5,000 ft  17.7 deg/s @ 500 kt
#   20,000 ft  12.8 deg/s @ 500 kt
#   30,000 ft   9.4 deg/s @ 450 kt
# Almost a factor of two.  Climbing stores energy but costs turn performance
# while you are up there; diving buys both speed and a better wing.  That trade
# is the thing a locked-altitude game cannot have.
#
# CAVEAT: these are 1.5 s *transient* peaks.  Below about 300 kt the aircraft
# cannot hold them -- in sustained flight alpha climbs past 20 deg and it
# delivers barely 1 g.  Hence V_MIN_KT = 300 and the absolute N_RESERVE.
