"""JSBSim F-16 backend.

Five things about JSBSim will silently produce wrong physics rather than an
error.  Each is handled below and marked TRAP-n.

  TRAP-1  Neither run_ic() nor do_trim() starts the engine.  Measured with it
          off you get -1,351 lbf of windmilling drag and a glider.
  TRAP-2  run_ic() is not a reset.  FCS integrators survive it, so a reset
          after a hard pull answers the next full-aft stick with Nz = 0.99.
  TRAP-3  Attitude and rate ICs must be stated.  Otherwise an aircraft that
          ended inverted starts the next episode inverted, and "pull" is down.
  TRAP-4  position/distance-from-start-* is an unsigned distance.  Crossing the
          starting parallel reflects the coordinate.  Compute the local tangent
          plane from lat/long directly.
  TRAP-5  Euler angles are singular near the vertical: psi and phi can jump
          126 deg in a single 1/120 s step.  Guarded in AircraftState.nose_2d.

Also: throttle-cmd-norm 1.0 is full afterburner (throttle-pos-norm 2.0), not
military power, and FGFDMExec needs its root directory stated explicitly or a
second JSBSim installation can win.

        Two layers worth seeing: the *command* we wrote to fcs/*-cmd-norm, and
        the *surface* the FLCS chose in response.  They are not the same thing
        and the gap is often large -- the pitch channel is a g-command system,
        so a -0.52 elevator command lands as barely a degree of deflection once
        the FLCS has decided how much it actually needs.

        Note the rudder: it sits at ~12 deg with zero command.  That is the
        bundled f16's yaw channel, not us (JSBSim discussion #814).

        The three `pitch_*` entries open up the alpha limiter, which is
        otherwise invisible and explains most of "I am pulling full and nothing
        is happening".  The FLCS pitch channel sums three things and clips:

            pitch-scheduler = elevator-scheduler   pilot command, multiplied by
                                                   a gain that falls from 1.0 at
                                                   alpha 0 to 0.11 at 28.6 deg
                            + alpha-limiter-norm   alpha_rad * 1.0472, opposing
                            + g-load-pid           the g-command loop

        Measured at full aft stick, held 3 s at 20,000 ft: at 300 kt alpha
        settles at 15.8 deg, the schedule has cut pilot authority to 51 % and
        the limiter is pushing back 0.29, so only -0.12 of the -1.00 reaches the
        actuator.  At 600 kt alpha is 8.5 deg, authority 74 %, and the binding
        constraint is the g-command saturating instead.
