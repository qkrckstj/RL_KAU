    from aircombat_gym.tools.auto_operation import fly
    fly(env, act)          # act(obs) -> action

One of three tools over the same `render.py`, and the split is by who is
flying: a policy here, a person through the task's action space in
`wvr.play`, and a person over the raw airframe in `tools.manual_operation`.
The first two drive the task env; the third is a bench for the layer under it.

`act` is anything that turns an observation into an action, so this plays a
trained policy, a scripted bot or a constant.  It drives the *task env*, which
means what you are watching is what gets graded; a viewer built on its own
simulation is a nice picture of the wrong fight.

TacView Advanced (Windows only) can take the same fight live over TCP; pass
`sinks=[AcmiRealtime()]`.  Everyone else gets the pygame views, which is why
they exist.
