"""Regression tests for the flight layer.

Every test here exists because something silently went wrong once -- position
signs, crossing the origin, the gun line at the vertical, reset repeatability
after violent flight.  None of them raised an exception when they were broken.

These live outside the package on purpose.  `aircombat_gym` is what students
install and import; a test suite is not part of what it does, and keeping it out
means the tests exercise the package the same way a student does -- through the
installed import, not through a relative one.

    A tap of +30 has to turn 30 deg and stop.  That is the property the whole
    action space rests on, and it is the half of the tap/hold pair a policy uses
    for placement rather than rate: hold the same key and the target is re-aimed
    every step so the turn never ends, tap it once and it lands.

    It also guards the freeze semantics.  If a zero delta stopped freezing the
    target and started re-deriving it from the current state, the aircraft would
    drift past instead of arriving, and there would be no way to stop turning.

    There used to be a stronger claim here -- that +-15 and +-30 must also differ
    in *sustained* rate while held -- which forced the heading law into a taper.
    That was a 2D-era requirement (gate H3) and it cost 12-31 % of the settling
    time across the envelope, so both the requirement and the +-15 actions are
    gone.  Under the proportional law any command past about 4 deg of error
    saturates the same bank ceiling.
