"""The weapon and the scripted opponents: `aircombat_gym/wvr/`.

Ported from the 2D suite on 2026-08-10 with the modules they cover.  Most are
here because of a real incident rather than because the code looked risky:

  * `test_bots_are_behaviourally_distinct` -- a degenerate bot was once a
    byte-for-byte copy of `pursuit`, so the two tied exactly and an entire gate
    table meant nothing
  * `test_every_bot_flies_in_the_keyboard_tool` -- the tool and the env fed a
    bot two different dicts, and every bot with state crashed on its first frame
  * `test_the_vertical_is_in_the_weapon_model` -- `_kin` had vz inverted, which
    the 2D suite could not have caught

Named for the package directory it covers.  Observation spec and the
assignments themselves are in `test_envs.py`.
