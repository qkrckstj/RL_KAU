"""The observation spec and the assignments: `wvr/obs.py` and `aircombat_gym/wvr/envs/`.

Four groups, and the last one is the one that matters:

    spec        39 channels, frozen order, raw SI -- a policy binds to all three
    assignment  registration, closed channels, action round-trip
    no reward   D10, enforced by an AST walk over the package
    playable    `ace` can actually win, a policy is expressible from the raw
                observation, nothing goes non-finite

The weapon model and the scripted bots are in `test_wvr.py`; the flight model
and the envelope are in `test_aircombat.py`.

Two of these check a rule against the environment rather than against a module
constant:

  * `test_ace_can_actually_win` -- a terminal nobody can reach is not a
    terminal.  The old version did arithmetic on `DAMAGE_RATE`; this one flies.
  * `test_the_package_computes_no_reward` -- D10, now with an AST walk so it cannot
    rot the way a hand-written assertion would.
