"""`AirCombat/Evader-v0` -- kill a target that breaks when you close.

    import gymnasium as gym, aircombat_gym.wvr.envs
    env = gym.make("AirCombat/Evader-v0")

Everything is `Circular` except the target.  Same altitude, same closed
vertical, same `Discrete(9)`, same cone and lock, same clock.  Blue now cruises
until red is inside 2.5 km and forward of its 3/9 line, then breaks hard for a
random 2-4 s in a random direction.  It is armed, like every target on the
ladder.

**One thing changes and it changes the lesson.**  `Circular`'s target is a
fixed curve: its position two seconds from now is a function of the clock, so a
policy can score without ever reading the opponent's state -- and a mediocre
observation still gets most of the way there.  A break is a function of *where
red is*, so the same trick is worth nothing.  The intended difficulty is not the
turn; it is that the answer stopped being open-loop.

The break parameters are drawn from the env's generator, not from `random`, so a
seed still names an engagement (`main_dqn.py` seed bands).

**The clock is 240 s, not 120.**  Tuning the target could not make this task
tell tactics apart -- slowing it to 380-425 kt makes `ace` and `pursuit` both
score 1.00 across sixteen parameter cells, tightening the gun to a 15 deg cone
buys +0.02, and decelerating into the break buys nothing.  The clock did it:
`ace` 0.87 against `pursuit` 0.65, where the 120 s version was 0.77 against 0.67.
More time helps only the pilot who can convert it.

Two numbers are worth knowing before designing a reward:

  the break is survivable    the F-16 sustains ~12 deg/s at 20,000 ft and the
                             break commands 30 deg of heading; red cannot follow
                             it turn for turn from close in, which is the whole
                             point of `_trackable` in `Circular`'s worked reward.
  breaking costs blue        a 3 s break at 30 deg bleeds it toward red's guns
                             on the way out, so waiting is a real strategy and a
                             reward that pays only for closing will miss it.
