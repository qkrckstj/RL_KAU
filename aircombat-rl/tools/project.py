Every tool takes a **path** to the assignment folder as its first argument.  A
bare name would not do: the same assignment exists under `solutions/` and under
`templates/`, and a name that resolves to one of them by convention is a command
that keeps running after a move while measuring something else.

**The whole per-assignment configuration is the table below.**  Folder names
cannot supply the environment: `project_03_advantaged` runs `AdvantagedFight`,
so the convention breaks exactly where guessing would.

Everything else falls out:

    TITLE   from the number in the folder name
    DUEL    `issubclass(ENV, DuelEnv)` -- can the learner be shot down?  That
            decides whether seats are swapped when scoring, and asking the class
            is better than a hand-set flag that can disagree with it.

A submission never contains any of this.  The assignment is the professor's
side; the submission is `policy.py` + `wrappers.py` + weights (`tools.policies`).
